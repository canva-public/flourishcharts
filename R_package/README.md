# Overview

Interactive data visualization for data practitioners. `flourishcharts` allows users to visualize their data 
using Flourish charts that are grounded in data storytelling principles. Users can create racing bar & line
charts, as well as other interactive elements commonly found in d3.js graphics, easily in R and Python. 
The package relies on an enterprise API provided by Flourish.

This `R` package pulls d3 and WebGL graphs from the [Flourish](flourish.studio) data visualization API.

`flourishcharts` relies on `htmlwidgets` to render JavaScript in R.
